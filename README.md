# Python
This repository displays several basic machine learning algorithms. It is meant to be used as a starter for any type of project and therefore compiles the best algorithms in each respective field. It also englobes common data preprocessing, for instance NLP preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning, in order to accelerate the beginning of a new project. Feel free to give feedbacks and suggest improvements!

Thanks

## Repository still under construction
